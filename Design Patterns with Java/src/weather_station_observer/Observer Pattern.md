- The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its depndents are notified and updated automatically.
- Observer pattern is a great example of loose coupling.
- Publish-Subscribe Pattern is a more complex form of Observer pattern with multiple Subjects and/or multiple message types.
- We will see Observer Pattern again in MVC.
